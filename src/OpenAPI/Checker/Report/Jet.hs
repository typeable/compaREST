-- | A "jet" is a way of simplifying expressions from "outside". The "jetted"
-- expressions should still be completely valid and correct without the jets.
-- Jets just make the expression more "optimized" by identifying patterns and
-- replacing the expressions with "better" ones that have the same sematics.
--
-- The term "jet" in this context was introduced in the Urbit project:
--   https://urbit.org/docs/vere/jetting/
--
-- The pattern fits well for simplifying 'Behaviour' tree paths.
